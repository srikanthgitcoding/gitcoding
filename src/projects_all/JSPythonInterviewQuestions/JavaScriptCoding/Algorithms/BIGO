#time complexity
#-------------------
# O(1) -> constant time complexity - one statement 
# O(n) -> linear time complexity - one for loop 
# O(n2) -> QuaDRATIC - 2 nested for loops
# O(n3) -> cubic - 3 nested for loops
# O(logn) ->logarthmic -> if input size reduced by half - 

# Space complexity
# ----------------
# O(1) -> constant time complexity - one statement 
# O(n) -> linear time complexity - one for loop 
# O(logn) ->logarthmic -> if input size reduced by half -
