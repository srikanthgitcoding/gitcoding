available in my branch - How do I know Product journey is enable or disabled for a branch - how do I get this data ?

Additional Information

There is a generic requirement (on another team) to enable the management of what product journeys are available in a branch.
 This is likely reference data driven. 
 The (somewhat broken) mechanism, for Horizon, is to distinguish ‘core’ products from ‘non-core’ products. For the latter ‘non-core links' are created 
 between the product and every branch that takes that product.
